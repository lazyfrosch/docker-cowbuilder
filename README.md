Cowbuilder in Docker
====================

The copy-on-write chroot build tool for Debian.

Also see my [lazyfrosch/mock container](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyfrosch/mock/)

## Usage

Pull the image from Docker Hub

    docker pull lazyfrosch/cowbuilder

Have a look on the helper script `cowbuilder.example.sh` here and modify it to your needs.

    vim cowbuilder.example.sh
    cp cowbuilder.example.sh $HOME/bin/cowbuilder
    chmod +x $HOME/bin/cowbuilder

Then you can run cowbuilder like it would be installed locally.

In addition the cowbuilder script starts `cowbuilder-auto`, which will take care of creating
and updating the base chroots.

    cowbuilder login --distribution stretch
    # will create / update and give you a prompt inside

## Important notes

About the helper script.

* For correct permissions to work the helper script uses your UID and GID to write files
* The helper script mounts your HOME directory to the container
* Put the cache volume to a persistent location on your host
